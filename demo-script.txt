Brief introduction to your project:
Our project is called Pilexa - a portmanteau of the Raspberry Pi and
Amazon's Alexa. These ideas carry through to the current state of our project
which includes an application intended to run on a Raspberry Pi with a
microphone and speaker that can interpret someone's speech and perform tasks,
as well as an Android companion app to perform tasks and configure the Pilexa.

The third slide:
We unfortunately were not able to get the calendar skill implemented, or have
a screen in the companion App to create new composite skills. We also were not
able to put in a way to add new skills. The most challenging part was creating
a plugin-based system for skills where we could define skills in a JSON file
and do the minimal amount of programming for when the skill was actually invoked.
Another major hurdle was getting the companion App and Pilexa to communicate
correctly with Java sockets. Fortunately once we had a base the rest was easy.

The last slide:
Viv - I learned a lot more about AI - specifically natural language processing,
voice to text, and behavioral programming by creating Pilexa's backbone and also
from simulatneously taking an AI class which helped. If I could do anything
differently, I would have focused on what Android can do first and designed Pilexa
around that since smartphones have a lot more processing power than Raspberry Pis,
and because most of the functionality stems from things you can already do with
your phone, just through a different interface.
